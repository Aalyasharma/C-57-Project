        <p>My favorite hobby is reading books because it gives you knowledge about many facts. About history, geography, plants, animals, and much more. It widens your imagination and gives you a new perspective about things. It improves your grammar and vocabulary. It makes you thoughtful and knowledgeable. It opens you to many issues around the world and even improves your memory. There have been several books written by amazing authors that I have had trouble putting down. "The Hunger Games" trilogy, the "Ascendance" series, "The Traitor's Game" trilogy, "The Maze Runner" trilogy and it's prequels, the "Percy Jackson" series, and of course the "Harry Potter" franchise. In every one of these extraordinary books, there have been several inspirational quotes, songs, and naturally, the breathtaking characters- Peeta Mellark, Gale Hawthorne, Katniss Everdeen, Hermione Granger, Harry Potter, Albus Dumbledore, Annabeth Chase, Jaron, Darius, Mott, Thomas, Teresa Agnes, Kestra Dallisor, Cinna, and many, many more.

            “It crosses my mind that Cinna's calm and normal demeanor masks a complete madman.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Katniss, the girl who was on fire!”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Let us step into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.”

            <br>
            "I am what I am, an' I'm not ashamed. 'Never be ashamed,' my ol' dad used ter say, 'there's some who'll hold it against you, but they're not worth botherin' with.'"

            "It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more."

            <br>
            “A person can be educated and still be stupid, and a wise man can have no education at all.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Everyone gets scared at times. It's only the fools who won't admit it.
            <br>
            <br>
            “I never denied being a fool. That's the difference between us.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Above all else, I think that you are a compulsive liar."
            <br>
            <br>
            "Hardly. In fact, I consider myself a compulsive truth teller. It's only that everyone else seems compelled to misunderstand me.”
            <br>
            <br>
            "Well, you're rather fat. I doubt you'd fit onto my throne.”
            <br>
            <br>
            "Just because it's calmer than a hailstorm doesn't mean it's calm.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Nobody gives you respect in this life. You must take it, you must earn it, and then you must hold it sacred, because no matter how hard respect is to attain, it can be lost in an instant.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “The pirates wanted my life, Vargen wanted my country, and my regents wanted to paint rainbows over reality and claim all was well.”
